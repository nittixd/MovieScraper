# Movie Scraper Project

## What the Project Does

The **Movie Scraper Project** is a Python-based web scraping tool designed to extract detailed information about movies from the website "zona-leros.com". The script efficiently navigates through multiple pages on the site, collects links to individual movie pages, and retrieves key details such as titles, descriptions, genres, duration, distributor information, country of origin, producers, release dates, and image URLs.

## Why This Project is Useful

This project is particularly useful for anyone looking to aggregate movie data for analysis, research, or personal use. By automating the data extraction process, this tool saves time and effort compared to manually collecting movie details from multiple pages. It also provides a structured output in both JSON and CSV formats, making the data easy to analyze, share, or integrate into other projects.
